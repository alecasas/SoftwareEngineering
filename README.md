Our project’s aim is to create a client-server project that acts as a community hub; in other words, a volunteer network. With the use of the Google API, based on one’s location, we will display donation centers (good will, salvation army), community fridges, and non-profit organization centers. When local organizations are in need of volunteers, sanitary products, etc., they can create a posting in order to gain traction in the community. Ideally, we will implement two logins: one for organizations to post their events and projects and one for users to find community events near them.We will also use the Google API to display the location of local volunteer projects that are in need of participants and/or attendees. There already exists websites where volunteer services are provided, however, our aim is to be a medium through which organizations can get in contact with locals and vice versa. And, in the future, we also plan on creating an interface where the client can provide a word and/or phrase and a thread will be displayed based on their input. Our goal is to create a platform that can continuously be improved upon in order to give nonprofits and communities an efficient space to manage and promote their efforts.
